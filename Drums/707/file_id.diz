roland tr-707 percussion samples

these are 44100 Hz, 16 bit, .wav format samples from
the roland tr-707 drum machine. all instruments have
been sampled and cleaned up by me :)

recorded with a GUSMax via direct line level input.
if your application requires 8 bit samples or lower
sampling rates, let me know. you should, however, be
able to convert them yourself using a decent
downsampler / ditherer (like cool 1.52).
